## Introduction

The OpenLane ASIC flow is a comprehensive design process used for developing Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). This flow guides designers through multiple stages, starting with a high-level hardware description in Register Transfer Level (RTL) and ending with a Graphical Data System II (GDSII) file, which is essential for chip fabrication. Each step, from synthesis to physical layout, plays a crucial role in transforming a conceptual design into a manufacturable chip.

The process involves key stages such as synthesis, where RTL code is converted into a gate-level netlist, and physical design steps like floorplanning and power planning. The OpenLane flow integrates these stages seamlessly, ensuring that design constraints are met and that the final chip layout is optimized for performance, power, and area. Through this structured approach, designers can efficiently transition from design logic to a ready-for-fabrication layout.

## Theory and Lab Sessions

### Topic 1: Open-Source EDA, OpenLANE, and Sky130 PDK

**Theory: Understanding Chip Packaging and Wire Bonding**

In the world of embedded systems and semiconductor manufacturing, what we often refer to as a "chip" is, in reality, just the *chip package*. This package serves as a protective layer around the delicate silicon die, which contains the actual circuitry of the chip. The package plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and performance of the chip, providing physical support, protecting it from environmental factors, and enabling the chip to be mounted onto a board.

At the heart of the package lies the actual manufactured silicon chip, which is usually connected to the external environment using a method called *wire bonding*. Wire bonding uses fine wires to create electrical connections between the chip and the package, facilitating communication with the outside world. This method has been widely used due to its reliability and cost-effectiveness in mass production.

**Theory: Core, Pads, Die, and Foundry IPs**

The chip consists of two major regions: the *core* and the *pads*. The **core** is where all the fundamental digital logic is placed. It contains combinational circuits, as well as soft and hard IPs (intellectual property blocks) that define various aspects of the chip’s functionality. Surrounding the core are the **pads**, which form the interface between the core and the external world. These IO pads include input, output, and power pads, which allow signals to flow in and out of the chip. Together, the core and pads make up the **die**, the basic manufacturing unit in the semiconductor industry.

The chip is produced in a *foundry*, a specialized facility that fabricates semiconductor devices. Foundries provide *Foundry IPs*—pre-designed blocks of logic such as SRAM, PLLs, and ADC/DACs—that can be integrated into designs. These IPs require human expertise to develop, while simpler, repeatable logic blocks known as *macros* are more standardized and reusable.

**Theory: The Role of Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) and RTL Flow**

The *Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)* is a critical layer in defining how a processor interacts with the software running on it. It forms a bridge between high-level programming languages and the hardware. For example, a C program written for a specific chip undergoes several transformations before it can be executed. First, the C program is compiled into an assembly language that adheres to the **RISC-V ISA** (Reduced Instruction Set Computing – V). This is a simplified instruction set architecture designed to make chips more efficient and flexible.

Once compiled, the assembly language program is converted into **machine code**, a binary format (0s and 1s) that the hardware can understand. At this stage, a hardware description language, such as RTL (Register Transfer Level), is used to implement the ISA’s logic. The RTL code defines how the chip will process data and perform computations. The design then goes through a series of synthesis and verification steps, ultimately generating a **netlist** (a list of logical gates and connections) that is used for physical implementation.

The final stage in this process is the **Place and Route (PnR)** flow, where the design is translated into a layout file (GDSII), which is sent to the foundry for fabrication.

**Theory: Physical Design Kit (PDK) and OpenLANE**

A *Physical Design Kit (PDK)* is an essential interface between the foundry and the IC (Integrated Circuit) design engineers. The PDK provides a collection of files, libraries, and tools that describe the manufacturing process and ensure that the design is manufacturable. The PDK contains critical elements such as **device models**, **Design Rule Checks (DRC)**, **Layout Versus Schematic (LVS)** checks, and **standard cell libraries**. These elements help ensure that the design adheres to the foundry’s rules and can be fabricated correctly.

In this course, we focus on the **SkyWater 130nm PDK**, specifically the `sky130_fd_sc_hd` library, which is a part of the Sky130 open-source PDK provided by SkyWater Technology. This PDK is designed for the **130nm technology node**, which is widely used for educational and prototyping purposes. The PDK integrates seamlessly with **OpenLANE**, an open-source EDA toolchain that covers the complete physical design flow, from RTL synthesis to final GDSII layout generation.

OpenLANE offers a set of open-source tools for each step of the design process, making it possible to take an RTL design and produce a manufacturable layout, all within an open-source framework. It democratizes chip design by allowing users to access tools and flows that were traditionally locked behind expensive commercial licenses.

1. **Specification**
2. **RTL Design**
3. **Functional Verification**
4. **Synthesis**
5. **Design for Test (DFT)**
6. **Floorplanning**

## Power Integrity Guidelines

1. Preplaced Blocks and Power Planning

Preplaced Blocks:
Identify and locate power planes, ground planes, and bypass capacitor footprints within your PCB design software early in the design process.
Consider preplaced blocks as starting points for power planning, but be prepared to adjust them based on your specific circuitry.
Power Planning:
Power Delivery Network (PDN):
Plan a robust PDN with a dedicated power plane and a solid ground plane. These planes should be strategically routed to minimize trace lengths and provide a low-impedance path for current delivery.
Consult your chosen PCB manufacturer's capabilities for plane and via formation to ensure efficient current flow.
Decoupling Capacitors:
Place decoupling capacitors (typically ceramic) close to power and ground pins of integrated circuits (ICs) to provide a local reservoir of charge and suppress transient voltage spikes.
Use a combination of bulk and local decoupling capacitors:
Bulk capacitors (10uF or higher): Positioned near the power input connector to filter out low-frequency noise from the power source.
Local capacitors (0.1uF or 1uF): Placed directly next to IC power and ground pins to address high-frequency noise generated by the IC itself.
2. Decoupling Capacitors and Ground Bounce/Voltage Droop

Decoupling Capacitor Placement:
Minimize the loop area formed by the power pin, ground pin, and decoupling capacitor. This reduces the inductance of the loop and improves high-frequency decoupling effectiveness.
Avoid long traces between decoupling capacitors and IC pins. Aim for the shortest possible connections.
Ground Bounce and Voltage Droop:
Decoupling capacitors provide localized charge to ICs during rapid current draw, preventing ground bounce (temporary voltage dips) and voltage droop (sustained voltage reduction).
By providing a low-impedance path to ground for high-frequency currents, decoupling capacitors maintain a stable voltage supply for your ICs.
3. Pin Placements and Power Integrity

Power and Ground Pin Distribution:
Distribute power and ground pins strategically across your ICs to minimize trace lengths. This reduces the inductance of the power delivery path and improves power integrity.
Consider using power and ground pins on opposite sides of your ICs for better decoupling capacitance placement.
Sensitive Circuits:
Pay close attention to the power pin placements of high-speed or noise-sensitive circuits. Provide dedicated power and ground planes or routing for such components.

#### 8. Once synthesis has accepted our custom inverter we can now run floorplan and placement and verify the cell is accepted in PnR flow.

Now that our custom inverter is properly accepted in synthesis we can now run floorplan using following command

```tcl
# Now we can run floorplan
run_floorplan
```

Since we are facing unexpected un-explainable error while using `run_floorplan` command, we can instead use the following set of commands available based on information from `Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/scripts/tcl_commands/floorplan.tcl` and also based on `Floorplan Commands` section in `Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/docs/source/OpenLANE_commands.md`

```tcl
# Follwing commands are alltogather sourced in "run_floorplan" command
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or

#### 9. Do Post-Synthesis timing analysis with OpenSTA tool.

Since we are having 0 wns after improved timing run we are going to do timing analysis on initial run of synthesis which has lots of violations and no parameters were added to improve timing

Commands to invoke the OpenLANE flow include new lef and perform synthesis 

```bash
# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command

```tcl
# Generating custom timing report
report_checks -from _29043_ -to _30440_ -through _14506_
```

*We started ECO fixes at wns -23.9000 and now we stand at wns -22.6173 we reduced around 1.2827 ns of violation*

#### 11. Replace the old netlist with the new netlist generated after timing ECO fix and implement the floorplan, placement and cts.

Now to insert this updated netlist to PnR flow and we can use `write_verilog` and overwrite the synthesis netlist but before that we are going to make a copy of the old old netlist

Commands to make copy of netlist

```bash
# Change from home directory to synthesis results directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/25-03_18-52/results/synthesis/

# List contents of the directory
ls

# Copy and rename the netlist
cp picorv32a.synthesis.v picorv32a.synthesis_old.v

# List contents of the directory
ls
```

Commands to write verilog

```tcl
# Check syntax
help write_verilog

# Overwriting current synthesis netlist
write_verilog /home/vsduser/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/25-03_18-52/results/synthesis/picorv32a.synthesis.v

# Exit from OpenSTA since timing analysis is done

Verified that the netlist is overwritten by checking that instance `_14506_`  is replaced with `sky130_fd_sc_hd__or4_4`

![Screenshot from 2024-03-26 11-01-25](https://github.com/fayizferosh/soc-design-and-planning-nasscom-vsd/assets/63997454/1ddb66da-64cb-426d-8d78-30370c63dacb)

Since we confirmed that netlist is replaced and will be loaded in PnR but since we want to follow up on the earlier 0 violation design we are continuing with the clean design to further stages

Commands load the design and run necessary stages

```tcl
# Now once again we have to prep design so as to update variables
prep -design picorv32a -tag 24-03_10-03 -overwrite

# Addiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow merged.lef
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_STRATEGY
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis

# Follwing commands are alltogather sourced in "run_floorplan" command
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or

# Now we are ready to run placement
run_placement

# Incase getting error
unset ::env(LIB_CTS)

# With placement done we are now ready to run CTS
run_cts
```

## Section 5 - Final steps for RTL2GDS using tritonRoute and openSTA

### Theory

### Implementation

* Section 5 tasks:-
1. Perform generation of Power Distribution Network (PDN) and explore the PDN layout.
2. Perfrom detailed routing using TritonRoute.
3. Post-Route parasitic extraction using SPEF extractor.
4. Post-Route OpenSTA timing analysis with the extracted parasitics of the route.

* All section 5 logs, reports and results can be found in following run folder:

[Section 5 Run - 26-03_08-45](https://github.com/fayizferosh/soc-design-and-planning-nasscom-vsd/tree/main/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane/designs/picorv32a/runs/26-03_08-45)

#### 1. Perform generation of Power Distribution Network (PDN) and explore the PDN layout.

Commands to perform all necessary stages up until now

```bash
# Change directory to openlane flow directory
cd Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/openlane

# alias docker='docker run -it -v $(pwd):/openLANE_flow -v $PDK_ROOT:$PDK_ROOT -e PDK_ROOT=$PDK_ROOT -u $(id -u $USER):$(id -g $USER) efabless/openlane:v0.21'
# Since we have aliased the long command to 'docker' we can invoke the OpenLANE flow docker sub-system by just running this command
docker
```
```tcl
# Now that we have entered the OpenLANE flow contained docker sub-system we can invoke the OpenLANE flow in the Interactive mode using the following command
./flow.tcl -interactive

# Now that OpenLANE flow is open we have to input the required packages for proper functionality of the OpenLANE flow
package require openlane 0.9

# Now the OpenLANE flow is ready to run any design and initially we have to prep the design creating some necessary files and directories for running a specific design which in our case is 'picorv32a'
prep -design picorv32a

# Addiitional commands to include newly added lef to openlane flow merged.lef
set lefs [glob $::env(DESIGN_DIR)/src/*.lef]
add_lefs -src $lefs

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_STRATEGY
set ::env(SYNTH_STRATEGY) "DELAY 3"

# Command to set new value for SYNTH_SIZING
set ::env(SYNTH_SIZING) 1

# Now that the design is prepped and ready, we can run synthesis using following command
run_synthesis

# Following commands are alltogather sourced in "run_floorplan" command
init_floorplan
place_io
tap_decap_or

# Now we are ready to run placement
run_placement

# Incase getting error
unset ::env(LIB_CTS)

# With placement done we are now ready to run CTS
run_cts

# Now that CTS is done we can do power distribution network
gen_pdn 
```
